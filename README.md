2021 Update: Been a while since I've actually used "manually" generated passwords like these. If you haven't heard of diceware [[1*]](https://theintercept.com/2015/03/26/passphrases-can-memorize-attackers-cant-guess/) | [[2*]](https://pypi.org/project/diceware/) - I strongly suggest you check it out.
